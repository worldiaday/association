How does the proposal process work? 

- [ ] Identify the area where a decision is needed and have an exploratory conversation to find out where the group’s preferences and concerns are.
- [ ] Based on that conversation and any additional research, one person or sub-group can develop a proposal that represents the discussion. --  It is at this stage where you [create a proposal on GitHub](https://github.com/worldiaday/board-commitees/issues/new/choose). 
- [ ] Send out a written version for people to review in Slack/Discord/Discourse, using the post template shared below. Specify the “respond by” date, providing a minimum of 1 meeting interval to allow for at least one in-person discussion during a weekly meetup. Pin the post in the channel and unpin after voting has completed.
- [ ] Review the proposal together via a thread in Slack/Discord/Discourse and in-person discussion. Get responses to any clarifying questions.
- [ ] Check for agreement by fist-to-five voting (described below). Responses of "four" or "five" mean consensus has been achieved and the proposal can be considered "approved." The group can now move forward to implementation of the proposal and/or to the next issue or topic. Ideally, "approval" is achieved when all responses are at least "three" and mostly "four" and "five."
- [ ] Document concerns, amendments, and results of voting in the ‘History’ section.
- [ ]  If a proposal gets has been accepted, change issue title from PROPOSAL to DECISION and unpin from the channel.
