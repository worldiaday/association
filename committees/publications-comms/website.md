The Website Task Force essentially serves as the architect and caretaker of WIAA's digital home, creating a space that not only provides practical value to members but also stands as a living demonstration of effective information architecture principles. As the most visible and permanent representation of WIAA online, the website requires dedicated attention to ensure it embodies the organization's expertise and values.
