# Online Community

The Online Community Task Force within WIAA's Publications & Communications Committee focuses on building and nurturing vibrant digital spaces where information architecture professionals can connect, collaborate, and grow together.

### Core Responsibilities

* **Community Building**: Create and maintain welcoming online spaces (particularly Discord) where IA practitioners can form meaningful connections across geographical boundaries.
* **Engagement Facilitation**: Develop strategies to encourage active participation, including discussion prompts, AMAs, themed conversations, and virtual events.
* **Moderation**: Establish and enforce community guidelines that promote respectful, inclusive, and productive interactions among members.
* **Onboarding**: Design processes to welcome new members, help them navigate community resources, and integrate them into the existing community.
* **Knowledge Exchange**: Create structured opportunities for members to share expertise, ask questions, and collaborate on challenges they face in their work.
* **Professional Development**: Organize mentorship programs, skill-sharing initiatives, and career development discussions within the online community.
* **Cross-Platform Integration**: Ensure cohesion between Discord and other WIAA platforms, directing members to relevant resources across the organization.
* **Feedback Collection**: Gather insights from community members about their needs and preferences to continuously improve the online experience.
* **Special Interest Facilitation**: Support the formation and growth of sub-communities focused on specific aspects of information architecture.
* **Metrics and Reporting**: Track engagement metrics and community health indicators to assess effectiveness and guide strategic decisions.

The Online Community Task Force essentially serves as the digital equivalent of hosts at a professional gatheringâ€”creating spaces where meaningful connections happen, ensuring everyone feels welcome, and fostering the conversations that advance both individual careers and the discipline as a whole.
