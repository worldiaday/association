Next steps: 
- Grace will archive this Slack but weâ€™ll need time for people to transition to Discord.
  - Email out to all the current Slack members
  - Message on #general about the transition
  - Slackbot to gently remind people to use Discord instead.
  - Note: Slack workspace will probably continue to exist but limited channels as people move
