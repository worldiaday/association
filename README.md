# About WIAA

## Our Mission

The World Information Architecture Association (WIAA) exists to:

* Build and connect a global community of IA advocates and practitioners
* Promote the role of Information Architecture in different fields
* Provide resources for learning and professional development
* Engage IA academics and professionals in research and development

The World Information Architecture Association (WIAA) exists to advance the discipline of Information Architecture. We champion the critical role of IA in creating meaning and understanding in a world of increasing information complexity. Through education, community building, and shared practice, we empower individuals and organizations to create information environments that are easily accessible, understandable, and actionable.

We want a world where people can easily find and use information they need. We believe in making complex information clear. Our goal is to build spaces—both online and in real life—where information makes sense and helps people. We work toward a future where finding information feels easy instead of frustrating, and where everyone can navigate the growing sea of information in their daily lives.

## What is Information Architecture?

> Making the complex clear and the confusing understandable

Information architecture is the practice of organizing and structuring information to make it findable, understandable, and useful. It's like creating a map that helps people find what they need without getting lost. When information is well-organized—on websites, in apps, or even in buildings—people can use it better to navigate complexity and accomplish their goals at ease.

As information continues to grow and change in our world, so does our understanding of information architecture.

## Who We Are

WIAA is a global community of educators, students, practitioners, and enthusiasts united by a passion for improving how humans interact with information. From coffee shops to university auditoriums across continents, our members are organizing grassroots events and building the future of information architecture one community at a time.

Founded on the principle that information should be structured to meet human needs, WIAA serves as the central hub for advancement, education, and application of information architecture principles worldwide. We believe that thoughtful information architecture is essential to solving many of today's most pressing challenges—from improving digital accessibility to combating misinformation.

## Our Impact: How We Advance the Field

Through our network spanning six continents, WIAA fosters local communities while maintaining global connections. We support the growth of Information Architecture as both an academic discipline and practical craft by:

* Organizing events like World IA Day that bring our community together
* Connecting diverse perspectives across cultures and disciplines
* Supporting educational initiatives, research, and innovation in Information Architecture
* Advocating for human-centered approaches to information design

Whether you're a seasoned professional, a curious student, or simply someone who cares about how information shapes our world, WIAA offers a place to learn, contribute, and grow in your understanding of information architecture.

## Our Origins

World IA Day began in 2012 as a project under the Information Architecture Institute (IAI), but when the Institute dissolved, the global community rallied to preserve what mattered most—the grassroots nature of local events connecting IA practitioners worldwide. This community-driven spirit led to the establishment of the World IA Association (WIAA) as an independent entity in 2019, ensuring these valuable connections and knowledge-sharing opportunities would continue to thrive.

## Community-Driven Leadership

WIAA thrives through the dedication of our globally diverse leadership team. With board members spanning \[6 continents/12 countries], our leadership brings together perspectives from across the Information Architecture community worldwide.

### Global Board of Directors

Our Global Board members emerge from the grassroots of our field - they are practitioners, educators, and advocates who understand the challenges and opportunities facing information architects today because they live them daily.

\[ORGANIZER TESTIMONIAL]

This global, community-driven governance ensures WIAA's initiatives remain relevant and accessible to practitioners across different cultures, contexts, and career stages. Board members often begin their WIAA journey as local World IA Day organizers, bringing valuable insights from their regional communities to our global initiatives.
