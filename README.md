# World IA Day Meetings
This repository contains agendas, minutes, and other materials for World IA Day board and committee meetings.

## How to use

### Issues
We will use issues to track proposals and decisions. 

Create an `issue` to create proposals. 
- Use Fist-to-Five emoji's to indicate agreement
- Use comments and meetings to host discussions. 
- Update the issue description 

An issue can tagged, associated to a milestone, linked to other issues (dependencies), attributed to a project (committee). 

### Projects
Projects will be used to indicate a roadmap for committees, if applicable. 

### Wiki
Not quite sure how Wiki will be used since we already use GitBook for documentation. 

## Where to find

### Meeting minutes

Meeting minutes will be housed in the `Code` section. Each committee has its own directory. Meeting minutes are organized by year. 

```
committee-name/  <-- top-level refers to the committee (board, governance, scholarship, etc)
  /yyyy/  <-- level 2 directories are years
    yyyy-mm-dd-minutes.md  <-- meeting agendas and minutes
```
