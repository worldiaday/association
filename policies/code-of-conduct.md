# Code of Conduct

World IA Day is dedicated to the empowerment of local leaders. Our celebrations inspire the global growth of information architecture as a community of practice. We are dedicated to bringing a diversity of thoughts and thinkers.

Volunteers are working hard to bring this amazing celebration to locations all over the world. Our community is growing rapidly, with an estimated 4000+ attendees participating in a growing number of locations worldwide.

No matter where in the world you are, we want to make sure that World IA Day is a safe and professional experience for all to volunteer for, attend, and speak at.

The Global Board of Directors of World IA Day have drafted the below code of conduct to be agreed to and upheld by any member of the global and local volunteer teams. This code of conduct applies to all volunteers and organizers, all venues and their hosts, all online meetings and forums, all attendees, and all speakers of World IA Day.

## We do not tolerate harassment in any form.

Our local teams are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof).

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in any context revolving around World IA Day, including talks, parties, social media and other online media.

If anyone in the World IA Day community engages in any of the aforementioned behavior, the local organizer, venue hosts, or global team may take any action they deem appropriate, from warning the offender to immediately expelling the offender from World IA Day service or attendance.

## We’re listening.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns regarding the conduct of our global or local volunteers, presenters, or attendees, please contact [safety@worldiaday.org](mailto:safety@worldiaday.org) where a member of our global team is dedicated to assisting all locations. They are trained in how to address and report any incidents brought to their attention. All reports will be handled in the strictest confidence.

## Should I report it?

If you answer “yes” to any of the following, please let us know.

* Do you feel unsafe or fear that someone else does?
* Do you have prior conduct-violating experience with members of our community that deters your participation in a celebration?
* Are you concerned about the appropriateness of language being used, views being expressed or the materials being shared at any of our events or via our social media channels?
* Did you witness something that you are not sure is appropriate based on our code of conduct?

## What happens if I report something?

### **Virtual events**

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organizer immediately.

Report a violation at the bottom of the Code of Conduct section in Vito, the online event platform. This opens a form where you can outline the problem and submit it directly to the organizer. You can also choose whether to include your email address or remain anonymous, and whether you'd like to request an email follow up.

* A report of this incident will be submitted to Global Safety team
* The local volunteers will be notified as well.

### **In-person events**

* First, we will listen.
* Then, we will help you to determine the options that we have based on the situation. We will also document the details to assure trends of behavior are uncovered across locations.
* Lastly, we will follow the situation to a resolution where you feel safe and you can remain anonymous to the offender if you wish to be.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all times for the benefit of everyone. We value your participation.
