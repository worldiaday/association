# Accessibility Statement

We want everyone who visits our site, the hub for World IA Day, to feel welcome and find the experience rewarding, including people with disabilities or those who use assistive technology and preference settings to make the Web easier for them to use.

### Making the site accessible

To help us make the World IA Day website a positive place for everyone, it is responsive, so it will reformat to fit onto different size screens.

We also used the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) as guidance. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities, and more user friendly for everyone, as well as identifying requirements for good practice in coding a site.

### Making World IA Day events accessible

World IA Day is more than a website. It’s an annual celebration, with events around the world run by dedicated teams of volunteers.

Creating an environment that accommodates all attendees is very important to our organization. Attendance should not be limited to certain people. We are a community that embraces diversity. Each celebration should emulate a welcoming and accessible environment.

If you need an accommodation or have a problem, we hope you will get in touch with the local organizers early and work with them, so you can enjoy World IA Day comfortably.

### How are we doing?

We’ve worked hard on the website to make sure that it stays accessible as new content is added. We monitor the website regularly to maintain this, but if you do find any problems, please get in touch.

If you enjoyed using our site, or if you had trouble with any part of it, please get in touch. We’d like to hear from you by email at [producer@worldiaday.org](mailto:producer@worldiaday.org) or [create an issue](https://github.com/worldiaday/website/issues)

If you are reporting a problem, it would help us if you provide the information advised in the Web Accessibility Initiative’s page [Contacting Organizations about Inaccessible Websites](https://www.w3.org/WAI/teach-advocate/contact-inaccessible-websites/) in your request.
