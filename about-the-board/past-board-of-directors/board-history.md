## Regional Directors

Regional Directors for World IA Day are instrumental in making sure that our celebration is scalable and each location is getting the attention it needs and deserves. They focus on nurturing new locations in their assigned region and act as a liaison between the local organizers and the global executive producer, answering questions as they arise and directing local organizers to the correct team member for assistance when needed.

In addition to having past experience as local organizers, regional directors are in a closer time-zone proximity to their local organizers.
