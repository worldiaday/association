# Global Board of Directors

World IA Association is a nonprofit volunteer organization with a board of directors who are the ultimate responsible body of the organization. These volunteers play a strategic role in determining the mission and direction of World IA Association, ensuring that the organization continues to operate in support of its mission and driving principles. Board members fulfill different roles and functions as needed.

## Board Responsibilities

As the leadership body of the organization and to satisfy its fiduciary duties, the board is responsible for:

* determining the mission and purposes of the organization
* strategic and organizational planning
* ensuring strong fiduciary oversight and financial management
* fundraising and resource development
* approving and monitoring World IA Day's programs, events, and services
* enhancing World IA Day's public reputation
* assessing its own performance as the governing body of World IA Day, Inc

## Board Selection

We strive for geographic, professional, and demographic diversity on our Board to reflect our global community. Board members must have demonstrated commitment to information architecture and previous volunteer experience with WIAA or World IA Day events.

## Current Global Board

The global board refreshes from year to year.  See [past-leadership](past-leadership/ "mention") for the archive of global board members.
